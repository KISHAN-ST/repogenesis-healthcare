# Akatsuki — Hospital Traffic Predictor

Akatsuki is a hospital traffic prediction project: a small research/demo app that models and predicts hospital visit volumes.

## About This Repository

This project lives inside the Repogenesis healthcare track and focuses on predicting hospital traffic using sample datasets and simple ML models. It includes a backend service, sample dataset, and a minimal frontend.

## Project Structure

```
backend/        # API, training & model files
frontend/       # Minimal web UI

README.md       # This file
```

## Usage

- See `backend/README.md` or `backend/app.py` for running the API.
- Use `train_model.py` to retrain on provided `dataset.csv`.

## Notes
